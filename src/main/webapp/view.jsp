				<h4>BIG DADDY!</h4>
				<p>The day which I can't able to forget in my life the day was going absolutely fine.
<br>The food was good 
<br>the location was good and we didn't find a traffic
<br>It was a great time but as we all say there's a silence before a tragedy
Actually, I don't know whether we did a right thing
Or a wrong thing.

<br><i>Silence</i> ..........
<br>I am not writing it. u already knew that thing
<br>
But it was ok ok 
Everything
The time we spend.
<br>Anshuman & Kanishk were good
because they only have the iPhone. which made it memorable. 
<br>Aastha was also good,She handled everything correctly. Actually it was my treat u all must thank meeeeee.....

<br>I don't know why I m even writing all the stuff it's funny right I guess it is.

				<p>
You have told me that your interview has been scheduled and you're not giving it by your company laptop and it's fine I guess.
<br>But what was funny was 
<br>You don't have a shirt and guess what you have called me for the shirt like just compare both of us regarding the size 
<br>but it was funny it looked like a lab coat or a long coat to u ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I am imagining ur face in that which makes me laugh.
<br>And by the way, my shirt and my laptop both got lucky for you.

				<h4>No Panner Pizza</h4>
				<p>I have to come to take my laptop and the shirt.
<br>But due to some office work, I was again late 
<br>The funny part is I met Mortien,while I was buying pizza,
<br> I don't know why we always collide whenever I am out.
Again thanks to your mom for the cooldrink

				<h4>Rush</h4>
				<p>Remember that day it was 12th of May you're about to leave and what the hell happened to the weather
<br>				I think u have a problem with your genes.
.......Well who knows.....
<br>
Your mommy gave 2 chapaties and sabzee
Which was awesome.......I must say.
<br>I don't know why u didn't like it.
After that, we left to catch the bus and we were on time 
Actually, we would be on time if you would have listened to me but it's okay.
<br>all fault goes to Nisha. She forced us to wait......

				<h4>Ups & down in Travel</h4>
				<p class="no-margin">It's 13th of may 
you have reached your destination and you haven't got the room at 6:16 a.m...
U must be thinking about what's happening to me in the morning..
<br>
By the way, I set the alarm at 6:35 because I thought you will reach Delhi around 6:50 but it's okay.
<br>I can't able to cancel the room at that time.
<br>The funny part was you have invested 2000 rupees for that 3rd classroom.
<br><i>Congratulations for the tab</i>
